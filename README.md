# QueryRegenrate
Have ever seen servers having 1/2 players and when someone joins it goes to 2/3 players?

### Installation
- Go to "server.properties"
- Set "max-players" to 1
- Download and upload this plugin to your plugins folder
- Restart your server
- Done!

Now everytime someone joins the server, the player count is gonna go up by 1.
He made this code and told me to publish this to GitHub, so I did.
